            <p>In order to, rejuvenate your skin, Orskin Aesthetic Clinic uses two        cutting-edge procedures called platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and plasma gel, often known as bioscience. These procedures harness the power of your body’s own healing capabilities. Although they both use platelet-rich components as a basis, their applications and advantages are different. Both techniques offer a natural and holistic approach to skin rejuvenation, harnessing the power of your body’s own healing mechanisms.</p>
            <p><strong>PRF:</strong><br>
            Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) therapy is a cutting-edge treatment that utilizes the healing properties of your own blood to promote tissue repair. PRF is a concentrated form of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) that is processed to create a fibrin matrix. It is derived by collecting a small amount of the patient’s blood, which is then centrifuged to separate the platelets, growth factors, and other beneficial components from the rest of the blood.&nbsp; Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) treatment is a safe and innovative therapy that utilizes your body’s natural healing properties.</p>
            <p>Key features:<br>
            1. Fibrin Matrix : This matrix functions as a scaffold to facilitate tissue and wound healing by supporting platelets and other growth factors.<br>
            2. Slow Release of Growth Factors<br>
            3. Rich in Leukocytes</p>
            <p><strong>Plasma gel / Bio filler</strong></p>
            <p>Plasma gel bio filler is a type of dermal filler derived from a patient’s own blood plasma. The process involves drawing a small amount of blood, which is then centrifuged to separate the plasma from the red blood cells. The plasma is heated to create a gel-like consistency. This plasma gel is then injected into the skin to act as a natural filler.</p>
            <p>The primary advantages of plasma gel bio filler are its biocompatibility and low risk of allergic reactions or side effects, as it is derived from the patient’s own body. At Orskin Aesthetics Plasma Gel&nbsp; is commonly used for facial rejuvenation, reducing wrinkles, and adding volume to areas like the cheeks and lips. The results are generally subtle and natural-looking, and because it is autologous (coming from the same individual), it reduces the risks associated with synthetic fillers. Plasma Gel Bio Filler: A Natural Approach to Skin Rejuvenation. The plasma) filler is then injected into areas of the face where volume is needed, such as the cheeks, under-eye area, and lips.</p>
            <p>Plasma gel bio filler is an innovative and natural method for facial rejuvenation, offering a compelling alternative to synthetic dermal fillers. This treatment harnesses the power of your own blood plasma to create a gel-like substance that can be injected to enhance facial volume, reduce wrinkles, and promote a youthful appearance.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits of Plasma Gel Bio Filler</strong></p>
            <p>Biocompatibility: Since the filler is derived from your own blood, there is a significantly reduced risk of allergic reactions or adverse side effects. Orskin Aesthetics Believe in Natural Results : The plasma gel integrates seamlessly with your tissue, providing subtle, natural-looking enhancements.</p>
            <p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
            <p>The use of autologous plasma eliminates the risk of introducing foreign substances into your body.Rejuvenation: In addition to adding volume, the growth factors in the plasma can stimulate collagen production, improving skin texture and elasticity over time.</p>
            <p>The best homecare product after the Plasma Gel or PRF is definitely &nbsp;Adipeau Cream</p>
            <p>To maximize the benefits of plasma gel bio filler and maintain healthy, rejuvenated skin, incorporating a high-quality homecare product like Adipea Cream into your skincare routine is highly recommended.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Adipeau Cream?</strong></p>
            <p>Adipea Cream is a specialized skincare product designed to complement and enhance the effects of aesthetic treatments like plasma gel bio filler. It is formulated with a blend of active ingredients that promote volume lost, &nbsp;hydration, skin repair, and regeneration.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits of Adipeau Cream</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Hydration: Deeply moisturizes the skin, helping to maintain the plumpness and smoothness achieved with plasma gel fillers.</li>
            <li>Repair and Regeneration: Contains ingredients that support skin healing and regeneration, enhancing the longevity of the filler effects.</li>
            <li>Protection: Provides a protective barrier against environmental damage, helping to maintain the health and appearance of your skin.</li>
            <li>Anti-Aging: Packed with antioxidants and nutrients that educe the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Use Adipeau Cream</strong></p>
            <p>For best results, apply Adipeau Cream twice daily, in the morning and at night, on clean, dry skin. Gently massage the cream into your face and neck using upward strokes, ensuring even coverage. Consistent use will help sustain the rejuvenating effects of the plasma gel bio filler, keeping your skin looking vibrant and youthful.</p>
            <p>Adipeau cream is a long-term treatment that gives a filler effect on the volume loss by aging or due to the environmental issues, it usually take approximately around 6 to 8 weeks but the result is promising.</p>`,

However, what makes our offerings stand out? Both the cutting-edge AdvaLight and UltraClear laser treatments are intended to change your skin with little recovery time.<br/> <br/> <b>UltraClear</b>: A New Development in Skin Rejuvenation The first cold ablative fiber laser therapy in the world is now available at Orskin thanks to the launch of the UltraClear laser. With more impact and reduced downtime, this is the second generation of CO2 lasers.

<b>Advalight :</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
Each of ADVATx's two wavelengths targets distinct chromophores and penetration depths to restore whole skin health, setting the gold standard. This energy-based device is highly effective in treating a variety of cosmetic and medical dermatology issues, including acne, rosacea, vascular issues, scars, skin rejuvenation, pigmentation, and melasma. Its dual 589nm and 1319nm wavelengths have been linked to 25 FDA cleared indications. It consistently produces long-lasting, off-the-table results.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>-589 wavelength:</b>
<br/>
589 wavelength can Target c. acne bacteria and pigment, the 589 nm wavelength is preferentially absorbed by oxyhemoglobin and has a penetration depth of up to 1.25 mm. This makes it the best option for treating vascular issues, pigmented lesions, rosacea, acne, and melasma.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>-1319 wavelength:</b>
<br/>

 Darker skin types are safer since the 1319 nm wavelength is preferentially absorbed by water and penetrates up to 2 mm. In addition to giving sebaceous glands a thermal impact to control the production of oil and sebum, it stimulates fibroblasts and encourages the formation of collagen for non-ablative skin resurfacing. When paired with the wavelength of 589 nm, it provides a powerful remedy for aggressive acne.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Dual-Wavelength Laser Therapy's Gold Standard The AdvaLight treatment is unique in the field of laser skincare. This next-generation yellow laser is an unmatched choice for treating a range of skin issues because it is the only solid-state laser that can produce two wavelengths in one location. The yellow and infrared light technology from AdvaLight can help enhance skin tone, texture, and general health, whether you're fighting wrinkles, melasma, acne scars, or vascular lesions. Beyond its versatility, AdvaLight is known for its safety and efficacy. Its intelligent design includes preset treatment modes, ensuring the most effective and safe results for our clients.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Pre-Preparation of skin Orskin style for optimal results </b>
<br/>
<br/>

To promote healing and guarantee the finest outcomes, it's critical to properly prepare your skin before receiving laser treatments like UltraClear or AdvaLight. At Orskin, we advise including Salmon DNA therapy or Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) in your pre-treatment routine. Both treatments enhance your skin's capacity to heal, laying the ideal groundwork for laser operations.
<br/>
<br/>

*PRF: Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is an autogenous material that is derived from a person’s own platelets and is used to enhance wound healing and tissue regeneration.
<br/>
<br/>

*Salmon DNA: The PDRN found in salmon DNA is up to 95% compatible with human DNA, which explains why it can directly influence the body's manufacture of collagen and cell regeneration. This ingredient can improve skin suppleness, minimize wrinkles, and hasten skin cell renewal. Injections of salmon DNA enhance the general look of your skin.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Post-Care: Ensuring Long-Lasting Results</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Post-laser care is just as important as pre-treatment preparation. After your session, we’ll provide you with a customized post-care plan, including hydration, sun protection, and the use of soothing products like our Aura Face Shield. This advanced shield helps calm and protect the skin while accelerating the healing process.
<br/>
<br/>
Post-Treatment Tips:
<br/>

The first stage in the Orskin Aesthetics team's post-care routine, which is crucial and extremely important, is applying sunscreen. Avoid direct sunlight and use high SPF to protect your skin.
