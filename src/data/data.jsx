Never once did I go back a 2nd time to anywhere except Orsi. I go every 2 weeks. Every time she does something different depending on what my skin needs at the time. Each facial is totally customized and I leave glowing every single time. Even though she has gone from a 1 room practice in another salon to having her own salon with multiple rooms, the service has not changed and in fact has improved with the addition of different protocols, new product ranges and even body services. Try her out. You will NOT be disappointed!",
