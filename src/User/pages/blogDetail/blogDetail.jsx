          In order to, rejuvenate your skin, Orskin Aesthetic Clinic uses two
          cutting-edge procedures called platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and plasma
          gel, often known as bioscience. These procedures harness the power of
          your body’s own healing capabilities. Although they both use
          platelet-rich components as a basis, their applications and advantages
          are different. Both techniques offer a natural and holistic approach
          to skin rejuvenation, harnessing the power of your body’s own healing
          mechanisms.

          <p>
            Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) therapy is a cutting-edge treatment that
            utilizes the healing properties of your own blood to promote tissue
            repair. PRF is a concentrated form of platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
            that is processed to create a fibrin matrix. It is derived by
            collecting a small amount of the patient’s blood, which is then
            centrifuged to separate the platelets, growth factors, and other
            beneficial components from the rest of the blood. Platelet-Rich
            Fibrin (PRF) treatment is a safe and innovative therapy that
            utilizes your body’s natural healing properties.

        <h3 className="font-bold">Plasma gel / Bio filler</h3>
        <p>
          Plasma gel bio filler is a type of dermal filler derived from a
          patient’s own blood plasma. The process involves drawing a small
          amount of blood, which is then centrifuged to separate the plasma from
          the red blood cells. The plasma is heated to create a gel-like
          consistency. This plasma gel is then injected into the skin to act as
          a natural filler.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary advantages of plasma gel bio filler are its
          biocompatibility and low risk of allergic reactions or side effects,
          as it is derived from the patient’s own body. At Orskin Aesthetics
          Plasma Gel is commonly used for facial rejuvenation, reducing
          wrinkles, and adding volume to areas like the cheeks and lips. The
          results are generally subtle and natural-looking, and because it is
          autologous (coming from the same individual), it reduces the risks
          associated with synthetic fillers. Plasma Gel Bio Filler: A Natural
          Approach to Skin Rejuvenation. The plasma) filler is then injected
          into areas of the face where volume is needed, such as the cheeks,
          under-eye area, and lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plasma gel bio filler is an innovative and natural method for facial
          rejuvenation, offering a compelling alternative to synthetic dermal
          fillers. This treatment harnesses the power of your own blood plasma
          to create a gel-like substance that can be injected to enhance facial
          volume, reduce wrinkles, and promote a youthful appearance.

          there is a significantly reduced risk of allergic reactions or adverse
          side effects. Orskin Aesthetics Believe in Natural Results : The

          foreign substances into your body.Rejuvenation: In addition to adding
          volume, the growth factors in the plasma can stimulate collagen
